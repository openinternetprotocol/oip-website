# Intro to OIP

This guide introduces the core components of the Open Internet Protocol (OIP) stack, detailing how the various layers integrate to enable scalable, secure, and efficient decentralized applications.

## Motivation
Decentralized applications often face challenges related to high transaction costs, limited throughput, and latency when interactions occur entirely onchain. OIP addresses these issues through a hybrid approach, combining persistent and verifiable onchain smart contracts with high-performance offchain messaging and data storage. This design ensures critical states like identity and authorization remain secure and immutable onchain, while offchain operations efficiently handle high-frequency interactions, significantly reducing costs, latency, and network congestion.

## Onchain Components

### Smart Contracts

The onchain portion of the Open Internet Protocol consists of modular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts. These contracts provide:

- **App Definitions:** Clear definitions and standards for applications registered on OIP through the `OIPAppRegistry`.
- **Identity Management:** Persistent, interoperable, human-readable identities managed via the `OIPIdRegistry` and `OIPNameRegistry` contracts.
- **Access Control:** Secure delegation and fine-grained access control mechanisms enabled by the `OIPAccessRegistry`.
- **Node Management:** Registration and verification of edge and relay nodes via the `OIPNodeRegistry`.

Smart contracts ensure persistent data management, essential for identity and authorization states, due to the transient nature of offchain relay nodes.

## Offchain Components

OIP offchain operations leverage decentralized networks, like [Waku](/networking-layer/waku), utilizing relay and edge nodes:

- **Relay Nodes:** These facilitate efficient message propagation without relying on the blockchain for high-frequency data operations.
- **Edge Nodes:** Operated by network participants--or in other words: users of apps built on OIP--edge nodes cache and provide data locally, significantly increasing data availability and resilience. Edge nodes also periodically provide cryptographic proofs, confirming data integrity and availability.
