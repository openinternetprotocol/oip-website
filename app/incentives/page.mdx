# Incentives

The Open Internet Protocol (OIP) is designed as a credibly neutral foundation for decentralized applications (dApps), intentionally abstaining from embedding native financial incentives or platform-specific token mechanisms. This neutrality is integral to OIP's design, ensuring fair access, transparent governance, and equal opportunity for any application built upon the protocol.

## User Incentivization

Applications built on OIP can independently introduce incentive structures to drive user adoption, enhance engagement, or fund further development. Common incentive mechanisms may include:

- **Application-Specific Tokens:** Apps may issue their own tokens to reward user activity, fund growth, or distribute value among their communities.
- **Revenue Sharing Models:** Apps can implement subscription or revenue-sharing models that reward users based on their contributions or interactions.
- **Reputation Systems:** Incentives similar to karma or reputation scores, rewarding constructive behavior and high-quality content.

OIP itself does **not** prescribe or implement a native token designed for user incentives. This design choice ensures neutrality, enabling applications to craft incentive schemes tailored specifically to their users' needs without interference or dependency on overarching protocol tokens.

## Credible Neutrality

OIP is explicitly designed to embody credible neutrality, meaning no single entity or company controls or disproportionately benefits from the protocol. This allows applications built upon OIP to succeed based solely on their inherent value, innovation, and user alignment, rather than through protocol-driven favoritism or token speculation.

By maintaining this neutrality, OIP ensures:

- **Equal Access:** Any developer or organization can build and grow applications without implicit advantage from protocol-level financial incentives.
- **Fair Competition:** Success depends solely on user value, innovation, and community adoption.

## Tokens and Governance

While OIP does not implement a protocol-level incentive token, it recognizes the importance of governance in decentralized systems. OIP may introduce or leverage a governance mechanism potentially accompanied by a governance token—distinct from user incentives—to ensure transparent, decentralized decision-making processes. For further details on governance models, mechanisms, and potential governance tokens, consult the [governance](./governance) section.

## Recommendations for App Developers

- Consider clearly defined use-cases when creating incentive mechanisms to avoid unintended user behaviors.
- Explore governance-oriented tokens if aiming to create sustainable, community-driven applications.
- Ensure transparency about how tokens or rewards align with user behavior and app growth objectives.
