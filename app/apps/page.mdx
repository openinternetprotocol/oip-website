# Apps
Applications built on the Open Internet Protocol (OIP) leverage a variety of components and standards to deliver decentralized, resilient, and user-centric experiences. This section provides an overview of key elements that developers should consider when building applications on OIP.

Parts of the Portrait Protocol are currently being migrated to the Open Internet Protocol and planned to complete in Q2 2025. Read more about the migration [here](https://portrait.so).

OIP is currently in the early stages of development. If you are a developer interested in building applications on OIP, please reach out to the core development team for guidance and support.

## Using the OIPAppRegistry
If you are a developer building on OIP, you can access the `OIPAppRegistry` smart contract to register your application and obtain a unique identifier. This registry provides versioning and messaging standards, ensuring consistent interpretation and encoding of messages across the network. Developers building applications on OIP should reference the `OIPAppRegistry` smart contract to access:

- **Application Identifiers:** Each registered application receives a unique, incremental numeric ID paired with a human-readable string identifier. These IDs provide deterministic, collision-free identification across the OIP network.

- **Versioning and Messaging Standards:** Every application entry includes versioning linked explicitly to a documentation resource (such as a URL or a CID containing natural-language specifications). This ensures consistent interpretation and encoding of messages, enhancing interoperability between applications.

- **Content Topics and Auto-Sharding:** OIP employs Wakuâ€™s auto-sharding mechanism to route messages efficiently. Content topics must include both the application name and version, formatted as `/application-name/version/content-topic-name/encoding`. Developers should use a `oip_testnet_` postfix during development to maintain separation from production traffic.

To learn more about the `OIPAppRegistry` and its usage, refer to the [Smart Contracts](/smart-contracts) section.
