# Messaging

This section outlines the messaging specification for applications building on the Open Identity Protocol (OIP). Messages in OIP are timestamped, cryptographically signed, and designed to be tamper-proof. Messages leverage Waku for transmission across the network.

<Callout type="info">
This spec is a work in progress and is subject to change.

## Content Topics

Content topics organize message distribution across the network. The following topic conventions must be adopted by applications:

- `app_xyz` represents the placeholder name of an application as registered in the `OIPAppRegistry`.
- `1` indicates the version number of the application, obtained dynamically from the `OIPAppRegistry`.
- `OIPid` identifies a specific user, retrievable via username from the `OIPNameRegistry` or directly from the `OIPIdRegistry`.
- `nodeAddress` refers to a specific node's address, obtainable from the `OIPNodeRegistry`.

Head over to [smart contracts](/smart-contracts) to learn more about the core contracts.

### Default content topics
The prefix `oip_testnet_` is used to denote the Open Internet Protocol, and is defined in the `OIPAppRegistry` and is automatically prefixed to all content topics. This is removed when the protocol transitions to the mainnet.

#### Default Topics
- `/oip_testnet_app_xyz/1/updates-all/proto`: Subscribe to updates from all OIP IDs within the app.
- `/oip_testnet_app_xyz/1/updates-${OIPid}/proto`: Subscribe to updates from a specific OIP ID within the app.
- `/oip_testnet_app_xyz/1/latest-${OIPid}/proto`: Obtain the latest state for a specific OIP ID.
- `/oip_testnet_app_xyz/1/requests-${OIPid}/proto`: Request the latest state for a specific OIP ID.
- `/oip_testnet_app_xyz/1/ping-all/proto`: Ping all nodes to check availability (response rate-limited to once per 24 hours per sender).
- `/oip_testnet_app_xyz/1/ping-${nodeAddress}/proto`: Ping a specific node (response rate-limited to once per 24 hours per sender).

Additional custom content topics and message structures can be defined in the `OIPNodeRegistry` by app developers to extend functionality as required.

## Message Format and Requirements

Messages must conform to the `14/WAKU2-MESSAGE` standard.

### Update Message
Update messages are sent by users to update their content state and sent over both the ``/app_xyz/1/updates-${OIPid}/proto`` and ``/app_xyz/1/updates-all/proto`` topics.

A basic OIP message structure contains:
- **Object** (`string`): A JSON stringified object representing user-generated content.
- **Previous CID** (`string | null`): CID of the previous message, forming a verifiable hash-chain. Initial messages use `null`.
- **Block Number** (`uint256`): Blockchain network block number for timestamp verification.
- **Chain ID** (`uint256`): Identifier of the blockchain network (e.g., Base Sepolia is `84532`).
- **OIP App ID** (`uint256`): Application ID from the `OIPAppRegistry`.
- **Signer** (`string`): Ethereum address of the content creator or authorized delegate.
- **Signature** (`string`): Ethereum signature of the serialized object for authenticity verification.

Example OIP message signing using Ethers:

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const object = '{...}'; // stringified JSON object, the structure of this object is defined by the app.
const previousCID = 'baf...'; // CID or null
const blockNumber = 123456;
const chainId = 84532; // Base Sepolia example
const OIPid = 2 // OIP ID of the user
const appID = 1; // App ID from OIPAppRegistry

const messageHash = ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256(
  ['string', 'string', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint256'],
  [object, previousCID || '', blockNumber, chainId, OIPid, appID]
);

const signature = await wallet.signMessage(messageHash);
```

## Interacting with the Network

### As a Node

- **Posting Updates**: Nodes broadcast updates when the local object state changes.
- **Listening for Updates**: Nodes subscribe to relevant content topics to maintain an up-to-date object state.

### As a Client

- **Requesting Data**: Clients request latest states via caching nodes or hosting nodes when local data is unavailable.
- **Node Ping**: Clients ping nodes to verify availability.

## Signatures

OIP messages require two signatures:

1. **Content Signature**: Verifies the authenticity of the user-generated content (`object`). Signed by the user's private Ethereum key.

2. **Node Signature (optional)**: Verifies the integrity and delivery of messages by specific relay or hosting nodes. Signed by the nodeâ€™s Ethereum private key.

## Waku Message Limitations

Waku messaging has specific limitations developers must be aware of:

- **Max Message Size**: Waku protocol has a maximum message size of **150KB**.
- **Recommended Size**: For optimal performance and reliability, individual messages should ideally be around **4KB** or smaller.
- **Binary and Large Data**: For content exceeding 4KB (images, videos, large files), store the data on IPFS. Reference the IPFS CID within the OIP message instead of transmitting raw binary data.

## Handling Large Content

For content exceeding recommended sizes, OIP advises referencing IPFS stored data:

```json
{
  "content": "View image",
  "mediaCID": "bafybeigdyrzt...",
  "mediaType": "image/png"
}
```

The message references the IPFS CID, with content retrieval handled separately via IPFS nodes.

## Reliability and Scalability

- **Rate-Limiting**: Node pings are rate-limited (once per 24 hours per sender-node pair) to prevent spam and resource exhaustion.
- **Waku RLN**: Waku has created RLN (Rate Limiting Nullifier) to protect against spam and Denial-of-Service attacks.

## Summary

OIP messaging enables secure, verifiable, and efficient communication via Waku. By adhering to these guidelines, application developers can build reliable and scalable decentralized applications.
