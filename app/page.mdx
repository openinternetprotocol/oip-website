# Welcome to the Open Internet Protocol
The Open Internet Protocol (OIP) is an open-source decentralized protocol designed to support the creation of scalable, censorship-resistant, and privacy-preserving social applications. OIP combines an onchain layer—implemented through Ethereum-based smart contracts—with an offchain peer-to-peer network composed of relay and edge nodes. This hybrid approach provides both robust security assurances and practical scalability.

At the core of OIP are smart contracts that define identity management, application-specific metadata, and verifiable data integrity. These onchain contracts underpin identity interoperability, allowing users of apps built on OIP to seamlessly transition between applications while preserving their digital identity and social graph.

A distinguishing feature of OIP, not present in comparable decentralized protocols like Nostr, ATProto, and Farcaster, is its extensive use of edge-node caching. Relay nodes in decentralized networks often prune data due to storage constraints or experience downtime, potentially compromising data availability. OIP addresses this issue by enabling users of apps built on OIP to participate as edge nodes, caching and re-serving content to the network. This decentralized caching mechanism significantly enhances data resilience, availability, and overall network sustainability.

Moreover, OIP is structured to encourage self-sufficiency at the application level. Unlike protocols that depend on centralized relays or hubs with prohibitive operational costs, OIP's lightweight architecture ensures applications remain accessible, independent, and operationally efficient, regardless of their scale.
