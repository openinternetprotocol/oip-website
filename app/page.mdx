# The Open Internet Protocol

 The Open Internet Protocol (OIP) is an open social protocol where every application user actively contributes to maintaining and expanding the shared state of the application they participate in.

### The Open Internet Protocol (OIP) 

The Open Internet Protocol (OIP) is an open social protocol where every application user actively contributes to maintaining and expanding the shared state of the application they participate in. By distributing responsibility for data storage and transmission across all users, OIP eliminates reliance on centralized infrastructure, creating a **scalable, lightweight, and self-sustaining** peer-to-peer network.  

##### OIP is built on four pillars:
1. OIP is permissionless, distributed, censorship-resistant, tamper-proof, and privacy-focused.
2. Every user of an application built on OIP contributes to its infrastructure without significant hardware overhead.
3. Every user's participation is quantified as social capital: constructive contributions elevate their measurable reputation within the network—reinforcing security and resilience—while disruptive actions correspondingly reduce it, thereby aligning individual incentives with the collective integrity of the system.
4. Every user's digital identity and data remain fully portable and self‑sovereign, ensuring seamless interoperability and preserving autonomy across decentralized applications.

#### Development Background

The Open Internet Protocol (OIP) originated as a core component during the development of [Portrait](https://portrait.so), a decentralized social identity platform. In addressing the challenges inherent in building a truly decentralized social infrastructure, our team discovered that the underlying protocol offered capabilities far beyond its initial application within Portrait. Recognizing this, we have chosen to evolve OIP into a standalone, open-source project.

OIP is released under the MIT License, inviting collaboration from the global community to further refine and expand its capabilities. Our goal is to foster an environment where innovation in decentralization can flourish, ultimately empowering users and developers alike to build the next frontier of open, distributed networks.
